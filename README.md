# STARPOWER

Author: Greg Loose

Design: STARPOWER is a Pac-Man inspired arcade game with a sci-fi theme and a fast-paced twist. Collect stars to build up speed, but be careful: you lose speed when you run into walls or enemy ships, and when you come to a full stop, it's game over!

How Your Asset Pipeline Works:

(TODO: describe the steps in your asset pipeline, from source files to tiles/backgrounds/whatever you upload to the PPU466.)

(TODO: make sure the source files you drew are included. You can [link](your/file.png) to them to be a bit fancier.)

How To Play:

(TODO: describe the controls and (if needed) goals/strategy.)

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
